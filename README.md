MathLab consists of three sessions presented by the Coordinators (2024-2025) of IITM's Mathematics Club. Links to the YouTube stream of these sessions along with PPTs and additional resources are provided in the respective folders (titled [Session 1](Session%201), [Session 2](Session%202) and [Session 3](Session%203)). Problem Sets which were also used as a qualifying criteria for the online program are provided in the [Problem sets](Problem%20sets) folder. The problem sets help to solidify the concepts that were taught live in the sessions.
