# Problem Sets

This folder contains 3 problem sets, each one testing concepts taught in the corresponding theory session.

- Problem Set 1 deals with numerical techniques for root finding, classification and formation of differential equations.
- Problem Set 2 deals with numerical techniques for solving differential equations.
- Problem Set 3 deals with LCCDEs, Fourier series, Fourier transforms and denoising data.

The solutions to these problem sets can be found in the [Solutions](Problem%20sets/Solutions) folder
