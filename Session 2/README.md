# Session 2 - Numerical Navigators

This is the second session of MathLab, presented by Aditi Vaidya and Pranjal Varshney. The session covers numerical techniques to solve ODEs using Euler's method and subsequent predictor-corrector improvements and PDEs using the finite-difference method along with an implementation of these techniques in GNU Octave.
